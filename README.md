# Kendo.DynamicLinq.Core
Kendo.DynamicLinq for .Net Core 

# Note
This repo is referred from Kendo.DynamicLinqCore by [linmasaki](https://github.com/linmasaki/Kendo.DynamicLinqCore). Related notes can refer it.

Just transform to netstandard 2.0 support library and change namespace to original [kendo-labs](https://github.com/kendo-labs/dlinq-helpers) so it not painfull for users upgrading their project from non .NET Core project.
